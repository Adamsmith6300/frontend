          It started with our appreciation for the incredible vendors in our
          neighborhood. Mid-pandemic we were visiting farmers markets and
          thought about how hard it must be for smaller vendors to sell once a
          week at a market. Especially during the lockdown.

          There are so many businesses around Vancouver that we were not aware
          of, so we wanted to build a platform to bring these vendors together
          online. We wanted to make it easy for other Vancouverites to find
          these amazing vendors and at the same time offering vendors an easy,
          low-cost way to deliver locally.
